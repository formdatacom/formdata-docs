# Privacy notice

This Privacy Notice explains how we, at Form-Data, process information about the visitors of our users’ websites in connection with the services we provide.

To keep things simple, in this Privacy Notice we’ll refer to the users of the services we provide as our “Users,” to our Users’ websites or services as “Sites,” and to the visitors to those Sites as "Visitors."

Visitors can visit certain pages, view, and fill out forms which in turn are submitted to Form-Data's service. We put together this Privacy Notice to help our Users understand the information we collect about their Site Visitors (a/k/a our Users’ users), and how that happens on their Sites. Our Users are responsible for publishing a privacy policy on their Sites that explains to their Visitors how data is collected via the Sites and how that information is used and disclosed.

This Privacy Notice does not apply to the information we collect about Users and those who visit Form-Data's website -- that’s covered in our Privacy Policy.

## Information We Collect About Visitors to Our Users’ Sites

We collect information about Visitors to our Users’ Sites in a few different ways--we collect certain information that the Visitors provide to the Site, we collect some information automatically, and we collect any information that our Users provide to us about their Visitors.

### Information a Visitor Provides to a Site

The main purpose of Form-Data service is to allow our Users collect and store information that their Visitors provide to them through website forms. The information provided by the Visitor in those forms is not controlled by Form-Data in any way. It may contain personally-identifying-information such as name, email and phone.

The forms that are used in the Sites can be of any nature. Some examples are contact forms, surveys & polls, registration forms, sales inquiry, support request, order forms and more.

### Information We Automatically Collect from the Site

We also automatically collect some information about Visitors to a Site. When our Users are embedding our script in their Sites, we use that script to collect non-personally-identifying-information that web browser make available, such as browser type, language preferences, referring site, operating system, etc.

This script also collects the IP address of the Visitor which is potentially-personally-identifying-information.

When a Visitor submits a form that is processed by our service, regardless of the script mentioned above, we automatically collect their IP address and the URL of the page where they have submitted the form.

### Other Information Provided by Our Users

We also collect any other information that our Users provide to us about visitors to their Sites. For example, a User may use the “backend” admin console to edit or add information about a specific Visitor.

Another way that Users provide information to us is through hidden fields in the forms that their Visitors fill. Those hidden fields can be embedded in the Site's forms and contain information that the User or Site collected about the Visitor, and provided to us for storage and correlation with the information that the Visitor is providing himself.

## How We Use Visitor Information
We use information about Site visitors in order to provide our Services to our Users. Our users may use our Services to, for example, collect information through polls, quizzes and other surveys, allow their Visitors to contact them, place orders, get payed, or open support tickets.

We may provide to our Users statistics information such as number of Visitors visiting their Site, how many have seen a page or a form and how many have filled a form.

We may determine the approximate location of a visitor’s device from the IP address. We collect and use this information to, for example, tally for our Users how many people visit their Sites from certain geographic regions.

We may also use and share information that has been aggregated or reasonably de-identified, so that the information could not reasonably be used to identify any individual. For instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our services.

## How We Share Visitor Information
We may share information collected about Site visitors in the limited circumstances spelled out below:

* Subsidiaries, Employees, and Independent Contractors: We may disclose Site visitor information to our subsidiaries, our employees, and individuals who are our independent contractors that need to know the information in order to help us provide our services to our Users and their Sites, or to process the information on our behalf. We require our subsidiaries, employees, and independent contractors to follow this Privacy Notice for information about visitors that we share with them.
* Third Party Vendors: We may share Site visitor information with third party vendors who need to know this information in order to provide their services to us. This group includes vendors that help us provide our services to our Users and their Sites. For example vendors that identify bot activity.
* Legal Requests: We may disclose Site visitor information in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request.
* To Protect Rights, Property, and Others: We may disclose Site visitor information when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Form-Data, our Users, third parties, or the public at large. For example, if we have a good faith belief that there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, we may disclose information related to the emergency without delay.
* Business Transfers: In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, or in the event that Form-Data goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, Site visitor information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. If any of these events were to happen, this Privacy Notice would continue to apply to Site visitor information and the party receiving this information may continue to use this information, but only consistent with this Privacy Notice.

## Other Tools

Our Users’ Sites may contain ads from third party ad networks and advertisers, and our Users may integrate other tools and services on their Sites (such as Google Analytics and third party plugins). Please note that this Privacy Notice only covers the collection of information by Form-Data, and does not cover the collection by any third party.

## Disclaimer

Form-Data does not hold any responsibility or liability to our Users' Visitors. Form-Data acts as data aggregator for its Users. Visitors who wish to implement their rights in regards to their data collected by Form-Data have to do so with our Users and their sites and services.
