# Export to CSV

You can export all submissions to a CSV format for backup or in order to import them into other services.

:::info Note
CSV files are limited to 10,000 records each. If you need more than that, split your export into multiple files by limiting it to shorter time frames.
:::

To export your submissions go to your form handler's admin page, and click the _Inbox_ menu.

You can filter the list using the from/to date filters available in the toolbar. The export will only include records that match the filters. 

When you're ready, click the _Export_ button and confirm the dialog. 

That's it! Your browser will download the exported CSV file.
