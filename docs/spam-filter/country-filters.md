# Filter by country

## Accept submission from specific countries

In some cases businesses use forms that are only targeting people in specific countries. For example, a local business in London is not expecting any submissions of its customer-support form outside of London, let alone from outside of the United Kingdom.

In such cases, you can configure the form to only accept submissions from specific countries.

:::caution Important 
Some people may use a VPN, which can make them appear as if they are located in a different country. This is not very common, but could happen.
:::

:::tip
You can see the origin country of every submission in your form's inbox. You also get this information in notification emails, if you have set them.
