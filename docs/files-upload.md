# Files upload

If you want to allow your customers uploading files, you can easily do so with Form-Data.

:::info Note
This feature is only available with the Premium plan.
:::

Form-Data provides a file upload widget.
When a user uploads files, they are uploaded directly to your files-bucket. You can get direct link to download them from the notification email, or from the Submissions Inbox.

To enable files-upload follow these steps:

1. Add a standard `input` field to your HTML form:
   In your HTML form, in the place where you want the upload button to appear, add an input field and set it's _role_ attribute as follows
   ```html
   <input role="form-data-uploader">
   ```
   Don't worry about formatting this field, it will be replaced with the upload button.
2. Import css and js:
   In the `head` of the page add the following css:
   ```html
   <link href="https://static.form-data.com/css/form-data-uploader.v1.css" rel="stylesheet">
   ```
   **Before** the `</body>` closing tag, add the following js:
   ```html
   <script src="https://static.form-data.com/js/form-data-uploader.v1.js"></script>
   ```
3. Test
   Before we move to customizing the experience, you can test your form. When you refresh your page, you should see that the input element was replaced with an upload button. Clicking it will open the upload dialog.

   You can try uploading a file and then submitting the form. You should get a link to download the file in the notification email and also in the Forms Inbox.

   :::info Note
   The files are uploaded **before the user submits the form**. The form's submit only sends the metadata related with the uploaded files. This improves the user experience because the user can see the upload process, and even manipulate images before uploading them.
   :::

### Customization
There are multiple aspects of the experience which can be customized by adding data attributes to the input field that you have created in step 1.

#### Button label
Add_ `data-fd-button-label` attribute and set the label to anything that you want. E.g.
```html
<input role="form-data-uploader" data-fd-button-label="Upload your CV">
```

#### Button style
The button is created with the class `form-data-upload-button`. You can set its style by creating a matching css class.

#### Disable webcam
Add `data-fd-disable-webcam` attribute and set it to `true` if you don't want the user to be able to share an image or video from her webcam. E.g.
```html
<input role="form-data-uploader" data-fd-disable-webcam="true">
```

#### Disable screen capture
Add `data-fd-disable-screen-capture` attribute and set it to `true` if you don't want the user to be able to share a screen captured image or video. E.g.
```html
<input role="form-data-uploader" data-fd-disable-screen-capture="true">
```

#### Maximum file size
Add `data-fd-max-file-size` attribute to define the maximum file size of a single file, in bytes. For example, if you wish to limit the file to 500KB, set the value to `512000` (500 * 1024). If you wish to set it to 7MB, set the value to `7340032` (7 * 1024 * 1024).

The default value is **10MB**.

E.g.
```html
<input role="form-data-uploader" data-fd-max-file-size="5242880">
```

#### Maximum number of files
Add `data-fd-max-number-of-files` attribute to define the maximum number of files that can be uploaded. The default is 5

E.g.
```html
<input role="form-data-uploader" data-fd-max-number-of-files="1">
```

#### Allowed file types
Add `data-fd-allowed-file-types` attribute to control which file types can be uploaded. 
* You can specify one or more types by separating them using a comma. 
* Each type can be represented by a **mime-type** string, or a **wildcard mime-type** string, or a **file extension** using a period. 
* You can combine all types in one list.

:::tip
Using mime type checks the actual data of the file, whereas setting the extension only checks the file name. Therefore you should favour using mime types, if possible.
:::

The default is `image/*` which means any image type.

Here are a few examples:
```html
// Only PNG
<input role="form-data-uploader" data-fd-allowed-file-types="image/png">
<input role="form-data-uploader" data-fd-allowed-file-types=".png">

// Any image or Video
<input role="form-data-uploader" data-fd-allowed-file-types="image/*, video/*">

// PDF or MS-Word doc
<input role="form-data-uploader" data-fd-allowed-file-types=".pdf, .doc, .docx">
```

#### Inline
Add `data-fd-inline` attribute and set it to `true` if you want the upload dialog to appear as part of your form rather than a popup experience.

E.g.
```html
<input role="form-data-uploader" data-fd-inline="true">
```

#### Height
Only in case of _inline_ experience, you can add `data-fd-height` attribute to control the height of the upload widget, in pixels. The recommended height is `42px + (71px x number of file you want to be able to see without scroll)`
E.g.
```html
<input role="form-data-uploader" data-fd-inline="true" data-fd-height="250">
```

#### Locale
You can control the language and locale of the widget by setting `data-fd-locale` attribute to one of the following supported locales:

### Files retention
You can control how much time uploaded files will be kept in your storage. This is useful for both regulation management and capacity optimization. This is controlled from your form's settings page in Form-Data web application.
Refer to [Files retention](data-retention#files-retention) for more information.

### Emailing links to files
The link to download files in the notification email contains a secure signed token to fetch the file. Therefore, anyone who gets this link will be able to download the file without log-in. It is possible to limit the time period for which the link will work. To do that, go to the form _settings > email > notification email_, and set the files link expiry. 
If you turn off the toggle, the link will be available as long as the file persists.
