# Data retention

You can control for how long data is going to be stored on Form-Data's servers. There are 2 different related settings:

* Data retention
* Files retention

### Data retention

This setting controls for how many days submissions are stored on Form-Data's servers. During this time the submissions are available via Form-Data inbox.
You can set this to any number of days between 0 and 730 days (2 years).
By default, submissions are stored for 90 days. 

To change this setting:
1. Navigate to the _Settings_ menu ⓵
2. Scroll down to _Data retention_ and move the slider ⓶

:::caution Note
Setting this number to 0 will still make Form-Data store the submission in its database, and only then delete it.
:::

:::caution Note
Submissions marked as spam are deleted after a few days, regardless of this setting.
:::

:::caution Note
Changing this setting only affects submissions that are made _after_ the new setting was made.

### Files retention

This setting controls for how many days Form-Data will keep files that were uploaded by your users.
You can set this to any number of days between 7 and 730 (2 years).

1. Navigate to the _Settings_ menu ⓵
