# Zapier

Zapier is a service that enables integration between web applications. It does that by connecting _triggers_ and _actions_ into _workflows_ called _Zaps_.

Zapier currently supports over 5000 web applications.
A form submission in Form-Data can be used as a _trigger_ in Zapier, which makes it possible to connect to any of the web applications available as actions. 

To create a _Zap_:
1. Click the _Integrations_ menu ⓵.
2. Scroll down to _Zapier_, and copy the _Integration key_ ⓶.
3. Choose the application that you'd like to connect with ⓷. In the example below we've used _Slack_
4. Click _Use this Zap_ button ⓸ of the integration that you'd like to create
5. You will be directed to Zapier. You have to log in, or create an account there. 
6. Follow the instructions provided by Zapier to complete your integration. When instructed to provide the integration key, paste the key that you have copied in step ⓶ above.
